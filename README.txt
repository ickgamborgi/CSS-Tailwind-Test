Each student is required to choose ONE of the following to complete:

HTML page. Add sample content (text and images, sample images are provided but
content is up to you) in Flex containers to create consistent alignment of content, and
blend CSS Grid with custom Flexbox styling to make the content responsive.

OR

using Tailwind, and apply various examples of utility-class styling available in the
framework.

Option (2) was selected.

In both cases, the page layout and content must be responsive for mobile and desktop, and you should try as much as possible to make the page look consistent (header,
